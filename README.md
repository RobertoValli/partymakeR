# partymakeR
An R package to match political party names across datasets.

Political and social scientists routinely work with cross-country data on political parties, needing to link party characteristics across data sources. 
The need to merge such different datasets results in time-intesive recoding of party names. We create a package that simplifies the routine of merging European political party data.
