# partymakeR
An R package to match political party names across datasets.

## Why `partymakeR`?
Political and social scientists routinely work with cross-country data on political parties, needing to link party characteristics across data sources.
Merging such different datasets results in time-intesive recoding of party names. We create a package that simplifies the routine of merging European political party data.

## What does it do?
`partymakeR` provides accessible R code to translate an input vector of party names from a dataset to an output vector or dataframe of codes and IDs from other datasets.
